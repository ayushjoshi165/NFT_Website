    Los Angeles, Year 2099
 
 Over the 21st Century, the world’s brightest engineers and cutting-edge scientists work to integrate machines and technology into the human body. 
  
 The merging of man and machine is successful, increasing our brains’ computational power and our life expectancy by 20 years. Despite these advances, humanity remains stuck on Earth, unable to escape the deepening crisis of climate change, nuclear war, and the Water Wars. Mars has been a useful outpost for mining rare minerals but attempts to set up human colonies there have failed.
  
 In 2095, a convention of the world’s greatest scientists is convened to discuss a path forward for the human race. They conclude that we must combine the speed, power, and longevity of robots with the complex problem-solving ability of the human brain, and they hope that this hybrid interface will help humanity become interplanetary. 
  
 A new Space Race begins, and companies from around the world compete to become the first to create a robot/human hybrid capable of traveling to Mars and building the first human colony there.
  
 RoboCorp quickly emerges as the front runner in melding human brains into robot models. The first Bionic Mind is created, a completely merged man and machine, his brain and body in perfect sync with each other. RoboCorp creates a fleet of Bionic Minds.
 
 The Bionic Minds live up to their promise – they are impossibly fast, strong, and intelligent. Multiple RoboCorp spacecraft filled with these super robots head to Mars, and it is on the red clay and fierce sandstorms of Mars that Bionic Minds create the next chapter in their story . . .
